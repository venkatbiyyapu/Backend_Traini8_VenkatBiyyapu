# Backend_Traini8_VenkatBiyyapu


This project is a **Backend_Traini8_VenkatBiyyapu** built using Spring Boot. It allows users to add and retrieve information about training centers, including details like center name, address, capacity, courses offered, and contact information.

The backend exposes RESTful APIs for creating new training centers, searching for centers by various parameters like ```centerCode, CenterName, pinCode, coursesOffered, state, city and capicity``` feilds and retrieving all the training centers.
